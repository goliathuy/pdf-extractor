# PDF Extractor Project Summary

## Project Objective

The PDF Extractor project aims to create a comprehensive PDF processing system with the following capabilities:

1. **Text Extraction** - Extract text content from PDFs while filtering out white/hidden text
2. **Image Extraction** - Extract and properly convert images (including CMYK to RGB)
3. **PDF Splitting** - Split PDFs into logical sections based on:
   - Equal parts division
   - Intelligent section detection based on Table of Contents structure
4. **Metadata Generation** - Create comprehensive metadata about extracted content and processing results
5. **Batch Processing** - Process multiple PDF files in batch with proper error handling
6. **Performance Optimization** - Monitor and optimize memory usage during processing

## Current Implementation Status

4. **Basic Splitting** - Implemented equal parts splitting functionality

### Phase 2: Intelligent Processing (Completed)

1. **TOC Analysis** - Analyzed Table of Contents structure of sample PDFs
2. **Fuzzy Matching** - Implemented fuzzy string matching algorithm for section detection
3. **Section Splitting** - Created logic to split PDFs by detected sections
4. **Overlap Validation** - Added validation to check for section overlaps
5. **Confidence Metrics** - Implemented match confidence scoring for sections

### Phase 3: Support Features (Completed)

2. **CLI Interface** - Implemented command-line interface with multiple options
3. **Memory Monitoring** - Added basic memory usage tracking
4. **Documentation** - Created README.md with API reference and usage instructions
5. **Basic Testing** - Implemented initial unit tests for core functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (In Progress)

1. **Batch Processing** - Enhancing batch processing capabilities
2. **Error Handling** - Improving error handling and reporting
3. **Type Checking** - Fixing type annotations for better code quality
4. **Performance Optimization** - Implementing memory management improvements
5. **Password Support** - Adding support for password-protected PDFs
6. **Testing** - Expanding test coverage and creating automated test scripts

## Architecture

### Main Components

1. **extract_pdf_content.py** - Core processing engine with text/image extraction and PDF splitting
2. **pdf_cli.py** - Command-line interface for end-user interaction
3. **config.json** - Configuration parameters for processing behavior
4. **test_pdf_extractor.py** - Unit tests for validating functionality

### Data Flow

1. User provides PDF file(s) via CLI
2. System validates input files
3. Text extraction with white text filtering is performed
4. Images are extracted and converted if needed
5. PDFs are split based on configuration (equal parts or sections)
6. Results are saved to output directory with metadata
7. Processing summary is generated

## Next Steps

1. Complete the batch processing feature with enhanced error handling
2. Fix type checking issues in PDF structure analysis
3. Implement comprehensive error handling for batch operations
4. Add performance optimizations for large PDF processing
5. Support password-protected PDFs
6. Complete and extend automated testing

## Performance Considerations

- Memory usage monitoring is critical for large PDF processing
- Batch size control needed to prevent memory exhaustion
- Parallel processing could improve performance but needs careful implementation
- Error handling must be robust to handle varied PDF content and structures

## Conclusion

The PDF Extractor project has successfully implemented core functionality for text extraction, image extraction, and intelligent PDF splitting. The system currently processes the 112-page test document successfully, extracting text while filtering out hidden text, extracting 231 images properly, and splitting the document into logical sections with confidence scores.

Work is ongoing to enhance batch processing capabilities, improve error handling, optimize performance, and expand test coverage to create a more robust and comprehensive PDF processing solution.
